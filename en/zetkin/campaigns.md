Does your organization simple actions and events with many participants?
Then Zetkin could revolutionize your campaigning.

## Plan smarter
The campaign tools in the organizer app _Zetkin Organize_ helps you plan
on-the-ground campaigns to meet the right people at the right time. The
action calendar help you achieve the right intensity over time and using the
distribution charts you can make sure you cover your entire turf. Once you
are happy with the distribution, "test" the campaign using the map playback
feature.

## Mobilize more
With Zetkin activists can more easily sign up and participate on their own.
Get ready to meet volunteers who never attended a meeting but would love to
help hand out your flyers.

To reach even further, organize a phone bank to sign activists up over the
phone, using Zetkin, of course.

## Quick and easy organizing
During the campaign Zetkin helps you keep track of sign-ups, bookings, action
contacts and reminders. All the small things that can add up to take hours
every day are taken care of using Zetkin in minutes.
