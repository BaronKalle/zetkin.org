Every experienced organizer knows the importance of the phone to reach out
and activate people in large numbers. There are people out there who want to
participate, but aren't motivated enough to take the step on their own.

## Share the work, stay in control
With Zetkin any number of activists can share the work of phone banking. You,
the organizer, create call assignments and assign callers. The callers only
have to sign in and get going.

As an organizer you can prioritize target groups to different callers based on
tags, e.g. if you want a specific caller to primarily talk to people with the
same mother language. Zetkin makes sure no one falls between the cracks.

## Mobilize, inform, recruit
Who you call and how best to call them varies. Calling to mobilize, inform or
recruit are completely different beasts. Using Zetkin's call assignment feature
you can do it all, and stay completely in control of the rules that dictate how
Zetkin selects targets.

Are you calling to sign people up for campaign work? Set up the assignment such
that Zetkin automatically stops selecting people to be called once they've been
signed up. A few days after they've participated, they can be automatically
reselected. Call back, ask how it went and if they would like to do it again.

Are you collecting responses to a survey? Zetkin can automatically deselect
those who submit a response, regardless of whether they do it over the phone
or on their own. Call everyone at most once a week, no more than three times
total to remind them, or shape the assignment any other way you prefer it.

## Get started quickly
If you want, you are completely in control of call assignments. If you just
want to get satrted Zetkin has built-in templates for common assignment types.
If you want to mobilize for a campaign, spread information about something,
collect survey responses or periodically stay in touch you will be up and
running in minutes.
