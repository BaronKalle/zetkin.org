Zetkin is all about making particiption simple. There are people out there who
are ready to work for your organization, who are on fire, but just haven't
taken that final step yet. Zetkin's aim is to open that door.

## Easier for newcomers
When you're new to an organization, all thresholds are extra high. Coming to a
meeting or visiting the local office can be intimidating. With Zetkin, people
who were never before active can approach the organization on their own terms.

## Participation in three simple steps
Participating in on-the-ground campaigning is done in three steps with Zetkin.

1. _Sign up_. The activist signs up on their own terms online.
2. _Organize_. An official organizes the day and sends out reminders.
3. _Show up_. The activist only has to show up where the action takes place.

## Make life easier for your cadre
For those of your activists who are the most active, Zetkin is a life saver.
The activist portal and _My Page_ helps keep track of bookings and assignments
so there's no need to try and keep it all in your head.
