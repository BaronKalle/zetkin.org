You can safely store your entire register in Zetkin, or just the information
you need to organize a subset of your member base using Zetkin. Keep the
database organized using a number of smart tools.

## Import your database
If you want to transfer people to Zetkin you can use our powerful importer.
Transfer just the data you need from any Excel file. You can even tag people
as they are imported based on data in your file.

## Stay organized using tags
If the people of your organization belong to separate groups, have different
interests or focus on separate issues, you can easily tag them. You can create
any number of tags, which then help you search for people, e.g. when creating
call assignment segments.

## Get to know your activists with surveys
Using Zetkin's survey tool you can let your people share their interests and
ideas. That way you get to know every activist. You don't have to keep it all
in your head. Zetkin lets you search for people, group them and keep them
organized based on any response to any question of any survey.

## Smart searches
Using Zetkin's smart searches, you can create complex filters that are updated
automatically when the content of Zetkin changes. You can search based on
almost anything, like campaign participation and experience, survey responses
or whether someone was reached during a phone bank.

By concatenating filters together, here are some searches you could have running
constantly.

* People who have not been reached in the past year.
* Anyone who stated in a survey that they want to help hand out flyers, but then
  never did.
