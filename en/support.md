## Manuals and guides
If you want to learn how to use Zetkin, our exhaustive manual is a good place
to start. The manual also contains guides that take you through common tasks
step by step. At the moment, the manual is only [available in Swedish](//manual.zetkin.org/sv).

## Post questions in our support forum
If you can't find the answer to your questions, please post them to our support
forum, where the community or a Zetkin Foundation representative will try to
answer as best we can.

## Courses and presentations
When you connect your organization to Zetkin, a full day course is included in
the price. The course takes place in the venue of your choice, and includes
material that you can use to further educate your organization officials.

The course contains both a hands-on part where you learn how to use Zetkin,
and a more generalized, theoretical part on how your particular organization
could improve your methods.

We can also offer tailor-made courses and presentations by experience Zetkin
organizers on how to use Zetkin or activist methods in general.

Please [contact us](/en/contact) if you want to book a standard course or
discuss one made especially for your organization.
