    Zetkin is developed by Zetkin Foundation – a company that works not
    for profit, but to radically change society in a socialist, feminist,
    antiracist and sustainable direction. That makes Zetkin very special.

        header: The story behind Zetkin
        kicker: |
            The Zetkin we know today has been developed since 2015. But before
            then Zetkin was created in the Malmö branch of Swedish socialist
            party Vänsterpartiet ("The Left Party") as early as 2013. Read the
            story below.

                    A programmer and an organizer get to know eachother through
                    The Left Party in Malmö. This sparks the idea of a tool to
                    improve organizing activism.

                    A pilot study is performed ahead of starting development,
                    using Google Forms for campaign sign-up and spreadsheets
                    for scheduling.

                    The first lines of code are written towards a system for
                    signing up to campaigns. The project is named "Zetkin".

                text: |
                    Zetkin is rapidly developed thanks to contributions by
                    several developers. The Left Party uses Zetkin in Malmö
                    to organize a series of campaigns, culminating with the
                    European election campaign in May. During the two weeks of
                    on-the-ground campaigning, 200 activists participate thanks
                    in large part to Zetkin.

                    Using Zetkin's new tool for over-the-phone mobilization,
                    more activists than ever participate in the Sep 2014 Swedish
                    elections. Over the course of one month, The Left Party
                    organizes more than 800 actions in Malmö, with historic 400
                    activists participating.

                    Having realized the importance of Zetkin, ideas about more
                    tools are spawned. To integrate the local member survey
                    with Zetkin, work on a new Zetkin survey tool commences.

                    The Malmö branch of The Left Party decides to distribute
                    Zetkin to radical movements. To do so, a new version of
                    Zetkin needs to be developed, and funds raised.

                    Following a wide invitation, ten programmers and other
                    skilled people interested in developing Zetkin gather in
                    Malmö, to discuss architecture, methods and goals for the
                    new Zetkin. A few days later the first lines of code are
                    written.

Zetkin Foundation is owned and democratically controlled by the members of
The Left Party in Malmö. That means that Zetkin Foundation is a very special
type of company.

## By activists, for activists
From our everyday life as activists in Malmö's progressive movement we bring
with us experience, and most importantly, an attitude. An idea that we can
bring about big change when we work together, even with small resoures. The
strength of the left is our numbers.

That why when we develop Zetkin, we do it using activist methods. Large portions
of the work happens on a volunteer basis. Our board is a working collective,
which makes it different from most company boards. We have constructed our
organization around the premise that it should be as easy as possible to
contribute according to one's ability.

That means that we don't just develop a tool for activists, we do it by being
activists ourselves. Just like we've always been.

## Change instead of profit
In the founding documents of Zetkin Foundation, the purpose is clear:

> To work for radical change of society, in a socialist, feminist, antiracist
> and sustainable direction (translated).


Zetkin Foundation does not work for profit, but to achieve change. Money is a
means to make our organization stable and sustainable, but it's never the end
goal.
