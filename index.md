Zetkin is a web based tool for organizing large scale activism. It is being
actively developed by a team of activists and used by the local Malmö branch
of the Swedish socialist and feminist party Vänsterpartiet.

Right now work is being done to polish and relaunch Zetkin as a tool for a
wider audience of radical leftist movements. Find more information here soon.

In the meantime, you can [log into Zetkin](http://zetk.in) or read more about
the work on our [development blog](http://blog.zetkin.org).
